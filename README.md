<a name="br2"></a>Variables

To create a variable type “VAR \*insert variable name here\* = \*insert value here\*” If you want to use a string as the value, put quotes around the value. Examples: VAR a = 99

VAR b = “Hello, world!”

Getting the value of PI

To get the value of PI simply type “MATH\_PI” and it will show you the
value. You can also put the value of PI in variables.

Examples: MATH\_PI

VAR a = MATH\_PI

Printing Values to the Console

To print values to the console you type “PRINT \*insert number, string, or
variable here\*.”

Examples: PRINT 99

PRINT “Hello, world!”
PRINT a

Running your code

You can have your code be inside a ﬁle named “\*insert title here\*.basic++”,
so you don’t have to write the same code every time you want to use it. To



<a name="br3"></a>run your code that is inside a ﬁle, open shell.py and type “run “\*ﬁle name
here\*””

` `That is all of the documentation I have written, there are
more features but I have not written them down here yet.
